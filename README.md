# Monte_Carlo
This GUI program is a retirement account simulator and can project potential balances at retirement


A Monte Carlo analysis is used by an overwhelming majority of financial advisors, planners, coaches, and other financial professionals. This analysis 
essentially projects what might happen in the next x years based on the standard deviation of the market (usually the S&P 500).

This program asks the user for a series of inputs based on their current status and what they anticipate in retirement (ex. retirement age). This factors 
in current income as well as employer match. Out of one thousand different scenarios, it will return the highest, lowest, and average retriement balance 
based on the inputs provided by the user.

Get started retirement planning! And remember the most important factor in retirement planning is concistency.
